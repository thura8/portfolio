          Of all the projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the years, these are the ones
          that mean the most to me. Many are open-source, so if something
          catches your eye, dive into the code, explore, and share your ideas
          for improvement. Iâ€™d love to see what we can build together! ðŸš€
